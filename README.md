# aws.simple-app

To help me understand how to access s3 using aws-sdk.

Created personal AWS account. \
Created s3 bucket. \
Placed a test file in the bucket. \
Ensured I used `aws configure` to set credentials andconfig files in `.aws` folder.\
Tested with listObjectsV2, getObject and putObject. All working.
